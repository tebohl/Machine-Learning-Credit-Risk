# Machine-Learning-Credit-Risk

In this assignment, I built a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.

Using data located in the Resources folder, I created machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. I focused on comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.
